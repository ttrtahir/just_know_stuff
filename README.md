# Implementations of "Just Know Stuff" from Patrick Kidger

This is a self-learning program which will be initially guided by the contents of the blog post "Just know Stuff" from Patrick Kidger. As the list narrows by implementing or eliminating (if seems necessary) the learning goal, new goals will be added via personal interest.

This repo is **not** a guide nor a list that will be in everybodies interest. It only includes the author's interests to an extend that will be formulated later on.

> Temp format for completing each topic:
> - ELI5 of the topic.
> - Infographic that explains the topic drawn by the author
> - Subtopics that will be (is already) explored 
> - A basic implementation of the algorithm/theory
> - Sample data
> - A proper implementation of the algorithm/theory that utilizes the given Sample data
> - Resources used (from Wikipedia/blog pages to academic papers)

Table of content will be added later on.
